# Introduction

This notebook forms our analysis which will be `knitr`-ed into a `pdf` and then uploaded to  `osf.io`.  It comprises three three sections: 

1. *Data loading*: loading the data into workbook and inspecting its contents
2. *Tidy data*: doing some simple manipulation with `dplyr` to  make the data frame *tidy*. Save the tidied dataframe. 
4. *Analysis*: do a simple logistic regression.  


# Data loading

Load the data using `read.csv()` into a data frame called `df_raw`:

```{r}

```

Check the dimensions using `dim` to make sure we've captured all the variables and observations. 

```{r}

```

Use the `str` command to check how the variables have been read in: 

```{r}

```

How use the `head` command to inspect the first few rows for a further check. 

```{r}

```

## Tidy data

We can use `mutate` with the function `factor` to create a new categorical variable called `dili`.  If we add add `pdili` to `t1dili` we get a unique set of *levels* (0,1,2) and we can *label* these how we choose.  
  
| `pdili`  | `t1dili` | `pdili` + `t1dili` (levels) |`dili` (labels)  |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 0  |  0  |  0 |'C' |
| 1  |  1 | 2   |'T1' |
| 1  |  0 | 1   |'T23'|

First make the categorical variable and save the new dataframe as `df_tidy`. Make sure you get the ordering of the labels correct! You'll also need to import `tidyverse`. 

```{r, message=F}


```

Now use `str` it was created correctly. 

```{r}

```

Use `head` on a subset of the columns to make sure the calculation was performed correctly: 

```{r}

```

Now delete the columns: `pdili`, `t1dili`, `time_to_onset_of_pDILI`, `liver_disease`, and `tb_site` by using `mutate` to set these to `NULL`. Use `str` to check again. 

```{r}


```

Now save the dataframe in `/data/processed/df_tidy.Rda`:

```{r}

```

# Analysis

![](fig/Table 3.png)

Here's we're just going to calculate odds ratios (crude and adjusted) for the first risk factor, `log10base_alt`.  I'll give you the code for the crude odds ratios, then you can fill out the details for the adjusted odds ratio. 

```{r}

```

Check the summary:

```{r}

```

Put the coefficients and standard errors into a dataframe for easy manipulation.
```{r}


```

Here we're doing three things: 
1. Clean up the column names using `janitor` (you'll need to install this). 
2. Change the row names to columns (otherwise they'll get lost). 
3. Use `rename` (from `dplyr`) to change `estimate` to `beta` for clarity 

```{r}


```

Now lets use the standard errors to get 95% confidence intervals:

```{r}


```

Now we can exponentiate the betas:

```{r}



```

To do the adjusted odds ratios, repeat as above, but the formula now includes `agegroup`, `sex`, `log10base_alp` and `log10base_bili` (e.g. 'dili ~ log10base_alt + agegroup...')
