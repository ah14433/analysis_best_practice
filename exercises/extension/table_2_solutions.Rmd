## Introduction

In this notebook we'll take you through some manipulations in order to reproduce some of table 2 from the paper, reproduced below:

![](fig/Table 2.png)

The figure comprises many different statistics: 

  1. median
  2. interquartile range
  3. total number of subjects with a particular variable measured (`n=178` subjects with weight measurements) 
  4. fraction of subjects with a particular variable (e.g. `4/185` are HIV positive)
  5. p-values for between group comparisons. 
  
We're not going to calculate p-values here although you're more than welcome to use this opportunity to do so. 

The main object of this workbook is to get used to using `group_by` and `summarise` in order to calculate summary statistics.  This should form a part of any statistical analysis. We'll go through it statistic by statistic. 

## Load data and libraries

Let's load the libraries and data: 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(FSA)
df <- read.csv('~/Google Drive/Courses/Analysis-best-practice/data/processed/dili-tidy.csv')
```

Take a quick peek at the head to make sure it's what we wanted: 

```{r}
head(df)
```

## Clean up the dataframe

We're not going to need all of these columns so let's just drop them:

```{r}
df <- select(df, -c(sex, tb_site, time_to_onset_of_pDILI, agegroup))
head(df)
```

While we don't really need `id`, we'll keep it to show which observations get changed/dropped etc. 

The *Controls* in the table are those with `dili==none` and the *DILI cases* are those with `dili==t1`.

**Q**: Use the [`filter`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/filter.html) command to remove all those observations which are not either `t1` or `none`. You'll need the `or` logical operator which is `|`. 

**A**: 
```{r}
df <- filter(df, dili=='t1' | dili=='none')
headtail(df)
```

Let's rename the `dili` levels to be `none -> control` and `t1 -> dili`.  This will make the summary headings more informative. For that we'll use the [`forcats`](https://forcats.tidyverse.org/) package. The documentation isn't so good for this, see the [*R for data science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html) chapter on factors (section 15.5). 

```{r}
df <- mutate(df, dili=fct_recode(dili, 
                             "dili"="t1", 
                             "control"="none"))
headtail(df)
```

**Q**: There's one last problem.  The units of the *ALT*, *ALP* and *bili* variables.  They're all in log10 units.  here we can use the [`mutate_at`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise_all.html) function, see one of the examples there - you'll also need to use the following function instead of `log`:

```{r}
ten_2_power <- function(x) 10**x
```

Then rename the them by using [`rename_at`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select_all.html): 

```r
rename_at(vars(matches("log")), funs(str_replace_all(., 'log10base_', '')))
```

Hint - figure out the correct functions to use first and then resave the dataframe. 

**A**:
```{r}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(matches("log")),ten_2_power ) %>%
  rename_at(vars(matches("log")), funs(str_replace_all(., 'log10base_', '')))


```


## Number of observations 

Now we have all our observations and only the columns we want.  

**Q**: use [`summarise`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise.html) with the summary statistic `n()` to calculate the number of rows in the dataframe. Call the summary statistic `num_obs`. 

**A**: 
```{r}
df %>%
  summarise(num_obs=n())
```

---

Not all that useful.  Let's increase it's usefulness by calling  [`group_by`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/group_by.html) first. 

**Q**: use `group_by` to calculate the number of observations the two levels of `dili`: 

**A**: 
```{r}
df %>%
  group_by(dili) %>%
  summarise(num_obs = n())
```

---

This is better.  Let's try to summarise the other variables.   To do this, we'll have to collect all the other columns into two columns - one that tells us what the variable is and one to tell us what the value for that variable is.  To do this we'll use [`gather`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/gather.html). 

**Q**: Discard the `group_by` line from above and gather all columns except `id` and `dili` into a key=`characteristic` and value=`value` column, pipe the results into `headtail()`. 

**A**: 

```{r}
df %>%
  gather(key='characteristic', value='value', -c(id, dili)) %>%
  headtail()
```

---

**Q**: Now we need to count the number of observations of each characteristic for `dili==none` and `dili==t1`. We can use a single call to `group_by` to do this. If you put two variables in the `group_by` call it will group them hierarchically.  We want to group by `dili` and `characteristic` - you decide which order to put them in (try both and see what happens).  After the `group_by` call, count the number of observations with `summarise`. 

**A**: 

```{r}
df %>%
  gather(key='characteristic', value='value', -c(id, dili)) %>%
  group_by(characteristic, dili) %>%
  summarise(num_obs=n()) 
```

---

**Q**: There's something obviously wrong here - the number of observations are the same for each characteristic.  This is because the missing values still count as an observation.  Instead of counting the number of observations using `n()` we will have to:

  1. convert the values to `FALSE/TRUE` if they `NA` or not using `!is.na()` (what does `!` do?)
  2. sum these logicals (`TRUE=1`, `FALSE=0`) using `sum()`. 

So change the formula in `summarise` to count the number of non-NA values. 
**A**: 

```{r}
df %>%
  gather(key='characteristic', value='value', -c(id, dili)) %>%
  group_by(characteristic, dili) %>%
  summarise(num_obs=sum(!is.na(value))) 
```

Great!  this is the information we need but the format isn't very nice. Let's have two columns with `dili=none` and `dili=t1` and the counts as the values. 

**Q**: Use [`spread`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/spread.html) to split the values in `num_obs` into two columns labelled `none` and `t1`: 

**A**: 

```{r}
df %>%
  gather(key='characteristic', value='value', -c(id, dili)) %>%
  group_by(characteristic, dili) %>%
  summarise(num_obs=sum(!is.na(value))) %>%
  spread(key=dili, value=num_obs)
```

## Median

Now we have the pattern for summarising the data into nice tables, it should be easy to calculate the median for those variables which are double precision (i.e. not 0/1 integer variables like `hiv`).  

**Q**: Use the `select_if` function to select only those variables which are floating ponit numbers (not integers) OR called `dili`.  To do this you'll need to use this [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39592879/r-dpylr-select-if-with-multiple-conditions)  from `aichao` with  the [`is_double`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/purrr/versions/0.2.2.2/topics/type-predicates) function form the tidyverse [`purrr`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/) package.  


**A**:
```{r}
df %>%
  select_if(function(col) is_double(col) | all(col == .$dili)) %>%
  head()

```

---

**Q**: Now we have that selection pattern, we can use a similar set of functions as before but replacing the `num_obs = sum(!is.na())` with the `median(..., na.rm=T)` function. You'll need to adjust the `gather` function as well. 

**A**: 
```{r}
df %>%
  select_if(function(col) is_double(col) | all(col == .$dili)) %>%
  gather(key='characteristic', value='value', -c(dili)) %>%
  group_by(characteristic, dili) %>%
  summarise(median=median(value, na.rm = T)) %>%
  spread(key=dili, value=median)
```

---

## Interquartile range

**Q**: The lower and upper quartile should now be likewise simple. Look at  `summarise` documentation to get the correct function. Call the lower quartile `lq` and the upper quartile `uq`.  Note in this one you'll not be able to `spread` the columns without  a bit more work (you can do it though using [`unite`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/unite.html)) and making the numbers characters. I've included this code as well in the solutions. 

**A**: 

```{r}
df %>%
  select_if(function(col) is_double(col) | all(col == .$dili)) %>%
  gather(key='characteristic', value='value', -c(dili)) %>%
  group_by(characteristic, dili) %>%
  summarise(lq=quantile(value, na.rm = T,probs = 0.25 ), uq=quantile(value, na.rm = T,probs = 0.75 ))
```

```{r}
df %>%
  select_if(function(col) is_double(col) | all(col == .$dili)) %>%
  gather(key='characteristic', value='value', -c(dili)) %>%
  group_by(characteristic, dili) %>%
  summarise(lq=quantile(value, na.rm = T,probs = 0.25 ), uq=quantile(value, na.rm = T,probs = 0.75 )) %>%
  # rounding and then saving as characters is an easy way of displaying fewer decimal places. There are other ways. 
  mutate(lq = as.character(round(lq, 1)), uq = as.character(round(uq, 1))) %>%
  unite("iqr", c(lq,uq),  sep=" - ") %>%
  spread(key=dili, value=iqr)
```

## %/Fraction

For integer variables (which really should be factor variables), such as `hiv`, we need to count the number of `0`s and the `1` in each level. 

**Q**: First, let's turn integer variables into factor variables using [`mutate_if`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/summarise_all.html) and the functions `is.integer()` and `as.factor()`.

**A**:
```{r}
df %>%
  mutate_if(is.integer, as.factor) %>%
  head() 
```

**Q**: Now it's easy just to select `factors` by using `select_if` with `is.factor`:

**A**: 

```{r}
df %>%
  mutate_if(is.integer, as.factor) %>%
  select_if(is.factor) %>%
  head() 
```

---

**Q**: We can `gather` in the same way as before.  Note, that this time we need to gather everything *except* `id` and `dili` as `id` is an integer variable. 

**A**: 
```{r}
df %>%
  mutate_if(is.integer, as.factor) %>%
  select_if(is.factor) %>%
  gather(key='characteristic', value='value', -c(id, dili)) %>%
  head() 
```

---

**Q**: The key to counting each value of each variable is to `group_by` `dili`, `characteristic` **AND** `value` and then count the non-`NA` values as we did before. 

**A**: 
```{r}
df %>%
  mutate_if(is.integer, as.factor) %>%
  select_if(is.factor) %>%
  gather(key='characteristic', value='value', -c(id, dili)) %>%
  group_by(dili, characteristic, value) %>%
  summarise(num_obs=sum(!is.na(value)))
```

---

**Q**: `spread`  `num_obs` by `value` column.  We should note that once we've `spread` the values, any `NA` represent `0`s - not actually missing values.  (Why?)  So after we `spread` the values, we can just convert all `NA`s to `0`s using the following: 

```r
mutate_all(funs(replace(., is.na(.), 0)))
```

**A**:
```{r}
df %>%
  mutate_if(is.integer, as.factor) %>%
  select_if(is.factor) %>%
  gather(key='characteristic', value='value', -c(id, dili)) %>%
  group_by(dili, characteristic, value) %>%
  summarise(num_obs=sum(!is.na(value))) %>%
  spread(key=value, value=num_obs) %>%
  mutate_all(funs(replace(., is.na(.), 0)))
```

---

**Q**: If you want you can now combine the `'0'` and `'1'` (note - they're strings, not numbers) columns using `unite` (and call it `fraction`), select the `dili`, `characteristic` and `fraction` columns and finally `spread` the `fraction` column by `dili`. 

**A**:
```{r}
df %>%
  select_if(function(col) is_integer(col) | all(col == .$dili)) %>%
  gather(key='characteristic', value='value', -c(id, dili)) %>%
  group_by(dili, characteristic, value) %>%
  summarise(num_obs=sum(!is.na(value))) %>%
  spread(key=value, value=num_obs) %>%
  mutate_all(funs(replace(., is.na(.), 0))) %>%
  unite("fraction", c('1','0'),  sep="/") %>%
  select(c(dili, characteristic, fraction)) %>%
  spread(key=dili, value=fraction)
  
```

Now knit this into the `html` notebook and then in the home directory: 
```
$ git add exercises/tidy_data.Rmd
$ git commit -m "Finished reproducing table 2"
$ git push origin master
```

Well done!
